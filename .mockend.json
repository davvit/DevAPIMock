         "rendered":"\n<p>It&#8217;s 2021 and we all know social media is the place to be. But how do you find the time to post often and consistently?\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With tools.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;ll talk about a variety of tools to help you save time and be more active on social media. You&#8217;ll be scheduling your social media posts &#8212; your own content and valuable content from others &#8212; in no time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Social Media Management Platforms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are SO many social media management platforms, it&#8217;s hard to keep track of them all! Here are a few I&#8217;ve used (and continue to use).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hootsuite<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hootsuite is the first social media management platform I want to mention. Their\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hootsuite.com\/plans\/free-signup\" target=\"_blank\">free plan<\/a> allows you to connect up to three social media profiles and schedule up to 30 posts. Definitely opt for the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https:\/\/hootsuite.com\/features\/extensions\/hootlet\" target=\"_blank\">browser extension<\/a> so that when you&#8217;re on a page that you want to share on social media, you can do so easily. Paid plans start at $29\/month and include 10 social accounts and unlimited scheduling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Buffer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Buffer is another well-known platform. Although it&#8217;s hard to find info on their <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">free plan<\/a>, I think it allows you to connect up to three social accounts and schedule up to 10 posts per account. They also have a\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/extensions\" target=\"_blank\">browser extension<\/a> for many common browsers. Paid plans start at $15\/month and include eight social channels and up to 100 scheduled posts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bulkbuffer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">BulkBuffer<\/a> is a neat, third-party scheduling tool. Create a text file, add the posts and links you&#8217;d like to schedule, upload, choose your profiles and push to Buffer. After that, head over to Buffer and reschedule if needed. You also can&#8217;t choose images, but if there&#8217;s a featured image associated with the link, it will pull that in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Publer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I started using Publer last year and I LOVE it. Their <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/publer.io\/plans\" target=\"_blank\">free plan<\/a> allows you to connect up to five social accounts and schedule up to 50 posts. Publer has <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.publer.io\/easily-share-content-with-publer-browser-extension\/\" target=\"_blank\">extensions<\/a> for Chrome, Edge and FireFox and you can <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.publer.io\/import-media-from-google-drive-dropbox-and-unsplash\/\" target=\"_blank\">upload media<\/a> directly from Google Drive, Dropbox and Unsplash. Paid plans start at $10\/month and include five social accounts, unlimited scheduling and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I snagged a lifetime deal for Publer on AppSumo, so I can also:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.publer.io\/share-your-canva-designs-directly-to-publer\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pull images in from Canva<\/a> <\/li><li>Connect RSS feeds (which is really helpful when I&#8217;m looking to post content from others)<\/li><li>Schedule an unlimited number of posts<\/li><li>Schedule recurring posts<\/li><li>Automatically recycle posts<\/li><li>Get hashtag suggestions<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of <a href=\"http:\/\/fbuy.me\/v\/renemorozowich_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AppSumo<\/a>, you may find some great lifetime deals for up-and-coming social media management platforms, so if you&#8217;re in the market for one, check there often. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MissingLettr<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Missinglettr solves the problem of writing content and sharing it once &#8212; they help you easily create up to <strong>12 months of social posts<\/strong> from <strong>one blog post<\/strong>. Their <a href=\"https:\/\/missinglettr.com\/pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free plan<\/a> gives you one social profile and 50 social posts. Once you publish a blog post, a campaign is created for you. Pick the hashtags (they suggest some), pick the images and pick the quotes (from your post), then schedule away! Paid plans start at $9\/month and include three social profiles and up to 500 scheduled posts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Helpful Tools<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Revive Old Posts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/tweet-old-post\/\" target=\"_blank\">Revive Old Posts &#8211; Social Media Auto Post and Scheduling Plugin<\/a> is a plugin you can use on your WordPress website to automatically post your links to your social networks. The free version allows you to post to Twitter and Facebook and their paid version (starting at $75\/year) allows posting on LinkedIn, Tumblr and Google My Business as well as some additional features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Online Automation Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several online automation tools that connect different apps together. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/zapier.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zapier<\/a> may be the most well-known, but <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/ifttt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">IFTTT<\/a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.integromat.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">Integromat<\/a> are others. Check the tool to see what integrations they support. Generally these services <em>look for an action<\/em> (let&#8217;s say when you publish or update a post) and then <em>do an action<\/em> (like post to Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>RSS Feed Reader<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Another tool I found recently is feeder.co. I signed up for a free account\u00a0 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/feeder.co\" target=\"_blank\">Feeder.co<\/a> is a feed reader and allows you to see recent posts from all the sites you follow in one place. Browse through the list and share any that look interesting using a social media management tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Too Much Automation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While automation is a great addition to your social media strategy, don&#8217;t let it be your only action. Make sure you visit each of your platforms on a regular basis. Engage and connect with people personally. If your post got any engagement, respond. Reply to and share other&#8217;s posts as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining automation with personal engagement will help you maximize your social media impact.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Originally published December 10, 2018<\/em><\/p>\n",

         "rendered":"\n<p>2020 started off well enough, right? I wrote my <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/2019-year-in-review\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4400\">2019 year in review<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/2020update\" target=\"_blank\">created some goals and tasks<\/a> and got to work. But sometimes life goes off the rails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Terrible Loss<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In February I found out my dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma; his doctor wanted him to start treatments immediately. After a very difficult battle with colon cancer in 2008, he wasn\u2019t 100% on board with undergoing chemo and radiation again. I accompanied him to a few doctor&#8217;s appointments and he eventually came around. He was to begin treatments at the end of March, but he hurt himself (multiple myeloma makes your bones really brittle) and had to go to the hospital. One week at the hospital preceded three weeks in a nursing home for rehab. During that time we weren\u2019t allowed to see him (due to covid lockdowns) except through the window for a few minutes at a time. His health declined rapidly and when he returned home after Easter and his 69th birthday, he lived for only 8 days before passing. I still can&#8217;t think about him or the events surrounding his death without crying. If you&#8217;ve ever lost a parent you were close to, you know that your world basically stops. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Another Loss<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For over 45 years, my dad was a mechanic; he took over his dad&#8217;s garage when my grandfather died in 1975. I grew up living close by; I have so many fond memories of time spent there, from riding my big wheels across the parking lot to working there in the summers during middle school. The garage was a place that was <em>always<\/em> a part of my life &#8212; a place I could always find my dad, doing his thing. He worked up until a few days before he went into the hospital. After he passed, there was a LOT of work to be done to shut the business down. I spent May &#8211; October cleaning, organizing, sorting and preparing for auction. We auctioned the building, contents, machines, vehicles and tools in October and closed on the garage at the end of November. For as much work as it was, I was grateful for the physical work, the distraction and for the opportunity to hold on to my dad just a little bit longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that being said, in addition to the havoc that the coronavirus wreaked, I didn&#8217;t get a ton done. BUT I did manage to do a few things AND I want to be accountable, so let&#8217;s dive in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had several business goals for 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Create checklists for each part of client\u2019s journey.<\/strong> I worked on this in Notion, but I still have more to do. I&#8217;d like to have a complete set of checklists by the end of 2021, including documentation for each step &#8212; potential lead to satisfied customer.<\/li><li><strong>Investigate project management system.<\/strong> In 2020, I used Basecamp and NiftyPM but ended on <a href=\"https:\/\/clickup.com?fp_ref=rene27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ClickUp<\/a>. ClickUp has a lot of great features; my favorites are that I can share a read-only view of a project with my clients and that I don&#8217;t have to use a lot of separate systems. (I was using Trello for leads, Basecamp for tasks for my contractor, Nifty\/Asana\/Google Drive\/Dropbox for project management, etc.). I&#8217;d like to continue to learn more about ClickUp so that I can get the most out of it (and see if I can use it to replace any other systems I&#8217;m currently using).<\/li><li><strong>Revisit my customer avatar.<\/strong> Absolutely zero work on this.<\/li><li><strong>Create and execute a content strategy.<\/strong> I was going strong through February, but did nothing after March. I consciously removed my recurring tasks and reminders to write blog posts and newsletters. Having too much on my to do list (or honestly, a to do list at all) was not working for me. I&#8217;d like to ease my way back in to regular content creation &#8212; one post per month, one <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/newsletter\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"4800\">newsletter<\/a> per quarter and regular social media posting (to be determined).<\/li><li><strong>Get branded thank you cards.<\/strong> With the help of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jennilathrop.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jenni Lathrop Design<\/a>, I got some kick-ass, custom cards and even sent a few out right after the new year.<\/li><li><strong>Find new images for my blog posts.<\/strong> Finding images can be really difficult for me (how many laptop images can one person use?!), but Jenni saved the day again and I feel SO much better about the images on my blog posts.<\/li><li><strong>Get new headshots.<\/strong> I got some great photos (see my home page and avatar) in the fall from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.staceylouisephotography.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Stacey Louise Photography<\/a>.<\/li><li><strong>Time block work in the morning, limit use of email, eat meals at the table and 30 minute walk once per week outside.<\/strong> No, no, not so much and not as much as I wanted. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Not listed above, but I also managed to refresh my website and hire a contractor (see more on the latter under learning). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in 2020 I started a new side project helping photographers with email marketing and automation. I put up a website and did some pro bono work, but once other priorities came to the forefront, I had to step back on this and near the end of the year I took the site down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I worked on some awesome projects this year with some great people!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Arron on <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/portfolio\/new-website-email-marketing-for-sound-supplements\/\">Sound Supplements<\/a><\/li><li>Linsey, Katherine and Kelly on <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/portfolio\/new-website-training-for-face-time-beauty\/\">Face Time Beauty<\/a><\/li><li>Scot and the BOOM team on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/prosper.psu.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">PROSPER in PA<\/a><\/li><li>Anne and Kelly on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/hookedthefilm.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hooked<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finances<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a few financial goals for 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Use YNAB for business.<\/strong> I started this at the beginning of the year but stopped when it was taking up too much time. I still use YNAB for my personal finances and love it. I may revisit at some point for my business finances.<\/li><li><strong>Increase my SEP contributions by at least 10%.<\/strong> Done and I also added more to my SEP throughout the year.<\/li><li><strong>Participate in the 90 day proposal challenge for Q1.<\/strong> Done and this was <strong>awesome<\/strong>. There are two variations on the instructions &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/90-day-money-game-pdf.png\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/90-day-money-game.png\">here<\/a>. The premise is that you can&#8217;t control how much you make but you CAN control how many proposals you send out (and what&#8217;s included in those proposals). My stretch goal was $45,000 in proposals (of which I sent out $33,030) and I landed $19,880 in projects. <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Proposal-Tracker-Q1-2020-FINAL.pdf\">See the results<\/a> or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1R0vb3h_DfiP8yaFS4ejTt3q0aQyLe6fjDzWgC0CI4AY\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">get a copy of the Google doc<\/a> so you can try this at home.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also added more funds to my HSA and requested a debit card that I can use for qualified medical spending.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community is important to me and I had a few community-related goals for 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Go to two WordCamps.<\/strong> There weren&#8217;t any in person ones, and the virtual ones weren&#8217;t super appealing, so this was scrapped. I did co-organize a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/wppittsburgh.com\/fall-2020-virtual-mega-meetup\/\" target=\"_blank\">virtual mega meetup<\/a> with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MaLandra_88\" target=\"_blank\">Miranda Knee<\/a> for the WordPress Pittsburgh group with three great speakers! I&#8217;d like to organize a few meetups this year and already have <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-WordPress-Developers-Designers\/events\/\" target=\"_blank\">two on deck<\/a>.<\/li><li><strong>Participate in a mastermind.<\/strong> I participated in Q1, but not for the rest of the year. If the opportunity arises, I would like to participate again. Half community, half personal &#8212; I had Friday Zooms with my great friend Ruanna all throughout 2020. We talked about everything from work-related problems to personal ones, and I am so grateful for her.<\/li><li><strong>Teach a WordPress course.<\/strong> I taught a non-credit, online course in the spring. Due to the timing it was mostly terrible &#8212; my dad was in the nursing home, then home, then had passed away &#8212; all in the four weeks of the class. But we got through it, and I ended up hiring my first contractor &#8212; a student in the class. Christie has been great and we&#8217;ve both been learning a LOT. I also taught my first <em>credit<\/em> WordPress course in the fall (online with the community college) and it was super! My students were very engaged and seemed to really dig the course. Some quotes from a mid-semester check-in:<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I love the course and am having a great time learning and developing my site and already have ideas for future sites I am going to create!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>You are doing amazing.

I was *just* starting to become one of those people who went to the gym and then the coronavirus hit. I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out how to exercise at home (I tend to do better going somewhere) OR outside (it&#8217;s always dark or cold when I&#8217;m ready to go out), but I&#8217;m going to keep working on this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December, my partner, kiddo and I did a webinar on making mug rugs (coasters) and I LOVED it. I&#8217;ve been making them ever since. I also did a few other crafts &#8212; stuffed hearts from some of my dad&#8217;s shirts, a shadowbox for my sister and a set of pillows (also from my dad&#8217;s shirts) with a book for my nephew &#8212; &#8220;My Pap Pap Wore This Shirt&#8221; (special thanks to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/apassionforthepen.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tara<\/a>).

         "rendered":"\n<p>Many entrepreneurs and small businesses use an email marketing platform to send monthly or quarterly newsletter-style updates, but did you know you can use email automation in other ways? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 3 quick and easy ways to use email automation in your business today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Potential clients<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First let&#8217;s start with potential clients. The first question that many potential clients have is about pricing. Add a form to your website where potential clients can request your pricing guide via email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that&#8217;s sent, they&#8217;re on your list and you can send additional follow-up emails to gauge interest and continue to nurture your lead. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole process might look like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A visitor fills out a form on your website to request pricing information<\/li><li>A workflow kicks off and an automatic email is sent delivering the pricing information<\/li><li>A follow up email is sent a few days later asking if they have any questions<\/li><li>An additional follow up email is sent a few days after that with additional information<\/li><li><em>You could even consider recording a quick video to include in one of these emails for an added personal touch<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a sequence of emails allows you to quickly serve and nurture potential customers without having to spend precious time answering the same questions over and over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New clients<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A great time to email a new client is immediately after they book but before their engagement. Think about what you tell your clients before an engagement now. Examples might include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What they need to know about working with you<\/li><li>How they should prepare for their engagement<\/li><li>What to expect during and after their engagement with you<\/li><li>When and how do they pay (if they haven&#8217;t paid already)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending helpful information to your new clients will not only allow them to get to know you a bit better, but will help them feel relaxed and prepared to work with you. (Plus you&#8217;ll look super professional in the process.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Existing clients<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider creating a follow up sequence that kicks off after you complete the client&#8217;s project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could include emails like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A warm thank you for choosing you. Ask them to tag you if they share any information on social media so that you can join the conversation<\/li><li>A request for for feedback. Include a link for a Google or Facebook review or direct them to a custom form on your website where you can ask your own questions<\/li><li>A request for a referral. Sweeten the deal by giving a discount to your client and the potential client<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you&#8217;re already providing a great service to your client &#8212; using email automation can add an extra personal touch that your clients will appreciate. <\/p>\n",

         "rendered":"\n<p>I&#8217;ve talked with several small business owners recently, and found out many are sending mass emails directly from their own email accounts. There are a TON of reasons why this isn&#8217;t a good idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>There may be sending limits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your email provider may <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"limit the number of emails you can send at one time (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/a\/answer\/166852?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">limit the number of emails you can send at one time<\/a>. Depending on the size of your list, you might have to send your email in multiple batches (ugh, more work). There won&#8217;t be a limit with a good email marketing provider like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"ActiveCampaign (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.activecampaign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">ActiveCampaign<\/a> or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"ConvertKit (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/convertkit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">ConvertKit<\/a>. Email away!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>There&#8217;s no way to unsubscribe<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending an email from your standard email provider lacks one SUPER important piece &#8212; the ability for the recipient to unsubscribe. If they want off your list but can&#8217;t unsubscribe, they might mark you as spam which could hurt your sender reputation. Future emails may not reach the intended target and may be sent directly to the spam folder. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email marketing providers will make sure you comply with the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"CAN-SPAM act (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/guidance\/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\" target=\"_blank\">CAN-SPAM Act<\/a> &#8212; a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only will you have an unsubscribe link in your footer, you&#8217;ll get feedback on <em>why<\/em> people unsubscribe. It&#8217;s a win win for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You have no idea what&#8217;s happening<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you send an email using your standard email service provider, there&#8217;s a lot you don&#8217;t know such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who has <em>opened<\/em> your email (and who hasn&#8217;t)<\/li><li>Who has <em>clicked<\/em> on a link in your email (and who hasn&#8217;t)<\/li><li>How your emails perform over time<\/li><li>If someone forwarded the email to a friend (and if so, who)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Email marketing software can give you all of those answers, allowing you to  craft better emails that get more opens, clicks and forwards. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You can&#8217;t tailor the experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Email marketing is all about delivering the <em>right message<\/em> at the <em>right time<\/em> to the <em>right person<\/em>. Your standard email provider can&#8217;t provide you with a tailored user experience like an email marketing provider can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scheduled emails and auto-deliver by timezone<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a small business owner, I often work on my own marketing during off hours. I don&#8217;t want to send emails during this time (it&#8217;s like texting someone in the middle of the night &#8212; rude), but I love being able to schedule emails AND to have them auto-deliver by timezone. This ensures that the emails are delivered when my clients are most likely to read them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Attempt redelivery (auto resend)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your recipients don&#8217;t open your email the first time, you can attempt to redeliver it with many email marketing platforms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A\/B testing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A\/B (or split) testing is a method of comparing two emails to see which one performs better. A slight tweak in a subject line, from name or even email content can help your email perform better (get more opens and more clicks). Many email marketing providers will allow you to create A\/B tests so you can learn what works best for you and your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about A\/B testing from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.activecampaign.com\/email-marketing\/ab-testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"ActiveCampaign (opens in a new tab)\">ActiveCampaign<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/help.convertkit.com\/en\/articles\/2502634-a-b-testing-in-convertkit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"ConvertKit (opens in a new tab)\">ConvertKit<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reengagement emails<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are people on your list who are never opening your emails, you could try to reengage them. With many email marketing providers, it&#8217;s as simple as creating a group or segment (of people who haven&#8217;t opened the past 5, 10 or 20 emails) and then sending them a <em>goodbye<\/em> email. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon receiving a goodbye email, they may open and reengage with you. If they don&#8217;t, you can unsubscribe them automatically. Both scenarios are good. In the first, they&#8217;ve reengaged and may start utilizing your service again. In the second, you&#8217;re not wasting time (or money) sending emails to people who aren&#8217;t interested in your services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to learn more about how an email marketing platform can help your business grow? <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/contact\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"4777\">Contact me today.<\/a><\/p>\n",

         "rendered":"\n<p>All too often I see contact forms that are just an afterthought. A carefully crafted form will help nurture your potential client and save you time. Below, I&#8217;ll walk you through seven ways to improve your contact form today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Collect all the appropriate information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical contact form has three fields &#8212; name, email and message. Think about what else you want to ask potential clients when they reach out including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Why they&#8217;re contacting you.<\/strong> Do they want to schedule a call? Do they have a general question? Something else? Include a selection field with all possible options and ask them to choose.<\/li><li><strong>What service they&#8217;re interested in.<\/strong> If you offer more than one service, include checkboxes so that they can pick what makes sense for them.<\/li><li><strong>Where they heard about you.<\/strong> Not sure how to tell what marketing efforts are working? Ask people to tell you where they heard about you &#8212; friends\/family, social media, Google, etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Make most fields optional &#8212; you&#8217;ll deter people if you ask too many required questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get really advanced, check if your form software offers <em>conditional logic<\/em>. This is where you can show additional questions based on answers you receive. For example, if you ask where they heard about you and they answer friends\/family, you can show an additional box asking who, specifically, so you can reach out to them and say thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Add a checkbox to opt-in to your list<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone is interested enough to fill out a contact form, they may also want to receive emails from you. Why not give people the option to opt-in to your email list right there?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research your form software and email marketing platform to see how you can connect the two. For example, if you&#8217;re using WordPress, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gravityforms.com\/add-ons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Gravity Forms (opens in a new tab)\">Gravity Forms<\/a> connects with ActiveCampaign, one of my favorite email marketing platforms. <a href=\"https:\/\/zapier.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Zapier (opens in a new tab)\">Zapier<\/a> may be another option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cut back on spam<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re getting a ton of spam via your contact form, look into implementing an anti-spam measure like a honeypot, a challenge question or a Google recaptcha. Humans are able to understand and get past these, but bots won&#8217;t be able to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Customize the email notification<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve collected all the information you need, make sure you&#8217;re getting everything via email. If you&#8217;re a team, you may want to set up multiple email notifications so that you all get notified of a new submission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also configure email notifications based on answers. For example, all the booking questions can go to team member A and all the general questions to team member B. Or all of the inquiries for the Cupcakes location to team member A and all the inquiries for the Ice Cream location to team member B.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to make sure your contact form works over time. We often don&#8217;t visit our own websites, but we should. Add a monthly task to your to-do list to test your contact form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, I mentioned Zapier for connecting your contact form to your email marketing platform, but you can use it in other ways, too &#8212; like sending inquiries directly to Google Sheets or Trello.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Redirect to a thank you page<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve all been there. We&#8217;ve visited a website, filled out a form and gotten the default message &#8212; <em>Form has been submitted successfully<\/em>. While that message technically does the job, there&#8217;s a lot left to be desired from a user experience perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you redirect your visitor to a thank you page after they&#8217;ve submitted your form, you have the opportunity to engage them further. Consider adding the following to your thank you page:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A heartfelt thanks for reaching out to contact you<\/li><li>Information on what will happen next, including when they&#8217;ll hear from you<\/li><li>Any other helpful information they might need to know &#8212; think blog posts, an FAQ or links to your social media profiles<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create an automated response<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We already talked about the email notification that you receive when someone fills out your form, but what about your visitor? Consider sending THEM an automated email after they fill out your contact form. Include the original submission information (their question) and some of the same information from your thank you page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simple act of letting your visitor know their message has been received (<em>and<\/em> you&#8217;re happy to hear from them) will go a long way in the customer service department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Consider the messages you&#8217;re receiving<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that the goal of supercharging your contact form is to 1) give your visitor all the information they need and 2) save you time. Look at the messages you&#8217;re actually receiving and brainstorm additional ways to streamline your process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people are contacting you to book a session, why not give them the option to schedule right away using a service like <a href=\"https:\/\/calendly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Calendly (opens in a new tab)\">Calendly<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re getting the same questions over and over, create a page, post or FAQ on your site with the answer. If you <em>still<\/em> get inquiries about the topic, create a canned response (using a service like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gmail-snippets.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Gmail Snippets (opens in a new tab)\">Gmail Snippets<\/a>) with the link to the page\/post so that you can respond quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Wondering how your contact form measures up? <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/contact\/\">Contact me today<\/a> &#8212; I&#8217;ll review your form and give you 3 actionable tips for improving.<\/p>",

         "rendered":"\n<p>One of the awesome parts of being a freelancer is collaborating with other freelancers, especially those who offer complimentary services. A few weeks ago over coffee, my friend Tara (a copywriter) pitched an idea to our friend Stacey (a photographer) and I &#8212; an in-person brand refresh. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is simple &#8212; entrepreneurs and small businesses <em>always<\/em> need help with great photos, great websites and great content, how often does this fall by the wayside? Why not offer a quick service jam-packed with value? 30 minutes with each of us where each person leaves with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A professional digital headshot<\/li><li>A list of exactly what to update on their website<\/li><li>A list of go-to content ideas for posts, email and social media<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We picked a name (Refresh Your Brand in 90 Minutes), a date (March 27), a location (Stacey&#8217;s studio) and brainstormed a list of small businesses who might be interested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I want to walk you through how I got a quick website up at <a href=\"https:\/\/90minuterefresh.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"90minuterefresh.com (opens in a new tab)\">90minuterefresh.com<\/a> and why this is an important piece of the puzzle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First steps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Domain name<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we had a name, it was easy to search for domain names. When choosing a domain name, look for something <em>easy<\/em> and <em>simple<\/em>. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"domainr.com (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/domainr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Domainr.com<\/a> is a great place to start. 90minuterefresh.com was available, so I picked it up from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Namecheap (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/loves\/namecheap\" target=\"_blank\">Namecheap<\/a> (free privacy included).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hosting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, I added the domain name as an add-on domain to my SiteGround hosting account. With my GrowBig plan, I can add additional domains at no additional cost. I created a new WordPress site and added a quick coming soon page. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Email<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not completely necessary, I created an email address at SiteGround (hello@), created a forward to my GSuite email and configured the &#8220;Send mail as&#8221; feature to receive and send email in GSuite. (No need to check an additional mailbox elsewhere.) As an added bonus, the email address adds an additional level of professionalism to our endeavor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site development<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Backups<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I create a new site, I always set up backups first. There is nothing worse than spending a ton of time developing a site, only to lose something because you don&#8217;t have a backup. I do double backups with ManageWP and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Updraft (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/loves\/updraft\" target=\"_blank\">Updraft<\/a> (backing up to Dropbox).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Template + page builder<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor Pro is my favorite builder, so I scanned their <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"library (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/library.elementor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">library<\/a> looking for a good starting point and ended up with the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"one-page wedding template (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/library.elementor.com\/one-page-wedding\/\" target=\"_blank\">one-page wedding template<\/a>. I didn&#8217;t love the pink from the template, so I searched for new photos on Unsplash. When I found <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"a good one (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/FIKD9t5_5zQ\" target=\"_blank\">a good one<\/a> for the header background, I sampled a darker green color from the clouds and looked for color palettes based on that color. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Putting it all together<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using content and additional images from Tara and Stacey, I put the page together. I configured the contact form and added a Google recaptcha. Lastly, I added a featured image.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Social sharing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"SEOPress (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/loves\/seopress\" target=\"_blank\">SEOPress<\/a>, I configured a meta title and description. I checked the social sharing preview on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Facebook (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/tools\/debug\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Twitter (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/cards-dev.twitter.com\/validator\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"LinkedIn (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/post-inspector\/\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn<\/a> AND shared the link via iMessage with a friend to make sure everything looked good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"2016\" height=\"762\" src=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/twitter-card-validator.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/twitter-card-validator.png 2016w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/twitter-card-validator-300x113.png 300w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/twitter-card-validator-1024x387.png 1024w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/twitter-card-validator-768x290.png 768w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/twitter-card-validator-1536x581.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2016px) 100vw, 2016px\" \/><figcaption>Twitter card validator<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1026\" height=\"688\" src=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/social-sharing-90minuterefresh.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4662\" srcset=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/social-sharing-90minuterefresh.png 1026w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/social-sharing-90minuterefresh-300x201.png 300w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/social-sharing-90minuterefresh-1024x687.png 1024w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/social-sharing-90minuterefresh-768x515.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1026px) 100vw, 1026px\" \/><figcaption>Sharing the 90 minute refresh via iMessage<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Launch + tweaks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I removed the coming soon and soft launched the site with some close friends and colleagues, asking for feedback.

I use WP Simple Pay on my own site and already have a Stripe account, so I was able to quickly install and configure to allow people to pay online. Here&#8217;s what I did:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Installed WP Simple Pay<\/li><li>Connected to Stripe (in test mode)<\/li><li>Created a form\/button<\/li><li>Added the shortcode\/button to the site<\/li><li>Configured the Payment Confirmation and Payment Failed pages<\/li><li>Tested the flow<\/li><li>Reconnected Stripe in live mode<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also created a page with a form to collect additional information after purchase and linked to it on the payment confirmation page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So why did I do all of this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is a website an important part of this event? For many reasons! An official website: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Shows cohesiveness of the offer with the legitimacy of a website<\/li><li>Gives people all the necessary information<\/li><li>Allows people to ask additional questions<\/li><li>Allows people to quickly pay online (creating a sense of urgency)<\/li><li>Lets people find us via Google and other search engines<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We sent the link to the website via email, text and social media along with a blurb about who we are and what we&#8217;re doing. For those friends who liked the idea but weren&#8217;t interested themselves, we asked them to share the link with their friends and on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReneMorozowich?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ReneMorozowich<\/a> gave me awesome feedback on tweaking my website.

Using Zapier, I connected several systems together. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1674\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/zaps.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/zaps.png 1674w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/zaps-300x138.png 300w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/zaps-1024x470.png 1024w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/zaps-768x352.png 768w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/zaps-1536x705.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1674px) 100vw, 1674px\" \/><figcaption>Zaps connecting GSuite, Stripe, Trello and Freshbooks<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I created templates for a full website build, a post-rollout recap and website care onboarding. I also updated my proposal and contract templates to be more thorough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal for 2020 is to create a checklist for each step of my client&#8217;s journey. I&#8217;d also like to investigate a project management system &#8212; in the past I&#8217;ve used Asana and Trello, but don&#8217;t love either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Establish an emergency plan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted to establish an emergency plan, but before I could, I had to set up:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Freshdesk for ticketing for care plan clients<\/li><li>ManageWP for all of the sites I support and any in development<\/li><li>Freshbooks for proposals, clients, invoicing and time tracking<\/li><li>1Password for all. the. passwords.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, I found a trusted friend and colleague who would be willing to take over for me in the event of an emergency. I wrote a short &#8220;what to do&#8221; document and shared it with her and my significant other. He has my master password and can grant her access to all of the above if needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Content and social media<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal for 2019 was two blog posts per month, one newsletter per month&nbsp;and to be consistent with social media scheduling and posting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was successful with almost everything except the blog posts &#8212; in the last two months of the year, I only wrote one blog post per month. However, I did join Instagram and started posting regularly there. I also implemented two lead magnets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to continue making valuable <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"YouTube (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCaG3V9_iFHzTCUNDUV9a3Pg\/videos\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube<\/a> videos to supplement my blog posts and I did five:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/email-opt-in-wordpress-contact-form-mailchimp-caldera\/\">Adding an email opt-in to your contact form<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/creating-a-thank-you-page-in-wordpress-and-redirecting-your-contact-form\/\">Creating a thank you page and redirecting your contact form<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/creating-an-email-sequence-with-mailerlite\/\">Creating an email sequence with MailerLite<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/installing-and-configuring-the-astra-theme-for-wordpress\/\">Installing and configuring the Astra theme for WordPress<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/how-to-install-edit-astra-starter-sites-new-wordpress-site\/\">How to install and edit Astra Starter Sites<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, I created videos for several presentations I gave during the year including <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/presentation\/freelancer-finances-wordcamp-presentation\/\">Freelancer Finances 101<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/presentation\/using-automated-email-marketing-sequences\/\">Using Automated Email Marketing Systems<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/presentation\/build-brand-great-impression-online\/\">Building Your Brand<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year I want to find and execute a content strategy that works for me. I&#8217;m enjoying Instagram, but the posts take me FOREVER to write. I&#8217;ve also found that some of my blog posts have led to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"traffic (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B6Is2t0B9xh\/\" target=\"_blank\">traffic<\/a> that doesn&#8217;t really help my bottom line. I did <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"creating (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/make-my-persona\" target=\"_blank\">create<\/a> a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"customer avatar (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amyporterfield.com\/2018\/11\/235\/\" target=\"_blank\">customer avatar<\/a> in quarter three, but need to revisit and make sure I know exactly who I want to work with and who I&#8217;m talking to. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Business cards<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fall of 2018, I redesigned my website based on new branding but I never updated my business cards. Sometimes you need a deadline to push you into action and mine was WordCamp Jackson in October. I went with a minimalist design, only including my name and <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/creating-a-customized-social-profile-page\/\">social profile link<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, I&#8217;d love to get branded thank you cards made and send them to clients after their new sites are released.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Optimize my website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To optimize my website, I added a premium caching plugin (WP Rocket) as well as a premium SEO plugin (SEOPress Pro). I also updated all of my meta descriptions and titles, created a new page specifically for my <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/presentations\/\">presentations<\/a> and reworked (and updated) my <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/portfolio\/\">portfolio<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halfway through the year, I had a crisis about the images I was using on my blog (that they were too varied and didn&#8217;t look good together). I replaced them with matching stock images, but I still don&#8217;t feel good about it. I&#8217;d like to fix this in 2020, finding images that work with each post and the overall design of the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Schedule<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My goals for 2019 included time blocking, turning off notifications, getting up once in awhile and going outside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was successful with time blocking a small portion of the time &#8212; mostly when I had very specific things to do in a short amount of time. I used a paper planner sheet (something like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"this (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/simpleasthatblog.com\/simple-as-that-daily-to-do-list\/\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"this (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/makinglemonadeblog.com\/the-one-printable-i-cant-function-without-free-daily-planner\/\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a> or the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"daily digital momentum planner here (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.productiveflourishing.com\/free-planners\/\" target=\"_blank\">daily digital momentum planner here<\/a>) for each day I wanted to time block. I&#8217;d like to be more intentional about this in 2020 where I include blocks for my own work, possibly early in the morning before I start on client work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was moderately successful in turning off notifications by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Enabling do not disturb on my phone from 10PM &#8211; 6AM<\/li><li>Customizing my phone notifications to only necessary ones; I also removed duplicates &#8212; I don&#8217;t need a banner AND a sound AND a badge<\/li><li>Removing all notifications and setting daily time limits for social media apps<\/li><li>Turning on do not disturb on my computer as needed<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, I would like to limit my use of email. Right now I have it open all the time and end up using it as a to-do list. I know a few people who only check email at certain times of the day, <a href=\"https:\/\/taraclaeys.com\/the-miracle-of-a-paused-inbox\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"pausing it other times (opens in a new tab)\">pausing it other times<\/a> and I&#8217;d like to try this. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Getting up once in awhile&#8221; and &#8220;going outside&#8221; were not nearly specific enough, so I&#8217;m counting these as a fail. For 2020, I want to eat breakfast and lunch at the table, free from electronics and take at least one 30 minute walk per week outside. (It doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but I have to keep goals achievable!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few of my favorite clients in 2019 were <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/portfolio\/online-store-and-email-marketing-for-melissa-gregersen-photography\/\">Melissa Gregersen<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/portfolio\/new-website-ongoing-care-dr-nancy-berk\/\">Dr. Nancy Berk<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/portfolio\/strategy-new-website-marianna-coiffure\/\">Marianna Coiffure<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/portfolio\/ongoing-care-email-marketing-chic-bahamas-weddings\/\">Chic Bahamas Weddings<\/a>. After working with Melissa on a landing page for her photography business, I realized that I love email automation, so I expanded <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/services\/lead-generation-email-marketing\/\">my offerings<\/a>. Later in the year I partnered with Termageddon to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/services\/privacy-policies\/\">website policies<\/a> to my clients as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also started two small side projects late in the year &#8212; stay tuned for an update on those!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finances<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial goals for 2019 included continuing to use the Profit First system and to set up automatic monthly contributions for my SEP IRA and HSA. I achieved all of those goals. I also gave a talk on freelancer finances at two WordCamps which was super fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, I would like to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Start using YNAB with my business finances and the Profit First system (I&#8217;m already using it for my personal finances)<\/li><li>Increase my contributions by 10% each<\/li><li>Do the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"90-day proposal challenge (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReneMorozowich\/status\/1213092115477073920\" target=\"_blank\">90-day proposal challenge<\/a> in the first quarter<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Meetups<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a WordPress Pittsburgh meetup organizer, my goal for 2019 was to plan interesting meetups, focus on diversity and speak myself for the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I scheduled seven regular meetups &#8212; a coffee get-together, a blogger meetup, two meetups on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Google Analytics (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/wppittsburgh.com\/google-analytics-wordpress-101-a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-ga\/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics<\/a>, one meetup on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"CMB2 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-WordPress-Developers-Designers\/events\/260523742\/\" target=\"_blank\">CMB2<\/a> with new speaker Miranda Knee, one meetup on using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"GTMetrix (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-WordPress-Developers-Designers\/events\/262078276\/\" target=\"_blank\">GTMetrix<\/a> with new speaker Alex Brinkman and one meetup on <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/presentation\/getting-started-with-email-marketing-on-your-wordpress-website\/\">getting started with email marketing<\/a> &#8212; that was mine!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, in lieu of a WordCamp, the group and I planned a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"October mega meetup (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/wppittsburgh.com\/fall-2019-mega-meetup\/\" target=\"_blank\">mega meetup<\/a> in October (complete with our own mega wapuu). We had three speakers, pizza and lightning talks. Around 40 people attended and everyone seemed to have a good time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"wppittsburgh.com (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/wppittsburgh.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">wppittsburgh.com<\/a> a quick refresh!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure about my goals for 2020. Many of the meetups had low attendance and I feel disheartened that people aren&#8217;t very interested in the group. We do have a plugin roundup planned for February, but I&#8217;m not sure beyond that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordCamp<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal for 2019 was to attend three WordCamps (including US) and apply to speak at one. I only made it to two &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/recap-wordcamp-kent\/\">WordCamp Kent<\/a> and WordCamp Jackson, but I spoke at both of those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love attending WordCamps for both the learning and networking opportunities. My goal for 2020 is at least two WordCamps (and I&#8217;d love for one of those to be <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"WCUS (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/2020.us.wordcamp.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">WCUS<\/a> which is during the week at the end of October).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Slack<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love being a part of the Business of WordPress Slack group, so my goal was to stay active in the group which I did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking with people online is great but meeting people in real life is awesome. I met least eight people from Slack in person &#8212; from Ireland to New Jersey to Michigan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mastermind<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another highlight of 2019 was participating in a mastermind &#8212; in quarters one, two and four with various members of the Business of WordPress Slack group and quarter three with the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Personal Productivity Club (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.personalproductivity.club\/\" target=\"_blank\">Personal Productivity Club<\/a>. My goal for next year is to continue to participate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Podcast or video guest<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal for 2019 was to be a guest on at least one podcast or video. I did pretty well with this!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Hallway Chats (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/hallwaychats\" target=\"_blank\">Hallway Chats<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Let's Meet for Copy (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/letsmeetforcopy\" target=\"_blank\">Let&#8217;s Meet for Copy<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"WP Round Table (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wproundtable\" target=\"_blank\">WP Round Table<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/presentation\/using-automated-email-marketing-sequences\/\">Productivity Summit<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/editorialfreelancersassociation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Editorial Freelancers Association<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"How to Sell Custom Consulting Services (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/customconsulting\" target=\"_blank\">How to Sell Custom Consulting Services<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been a guest on a few other podcasts that haven&#8217;t been released yet, so look for those in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Teaching<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t on my list for 2019, but I pitched and taught two four-week continuing education classes at my local community college on <a href=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/presentation\/building-a-website-with-wordpress\/\">Building a Website with WordPress<\/a>. I&#8217;d like to do this again in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learning<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had BIG plans for learning in 2019 &#8212; several lynda.com courses, the JavaScript for WP Bootcamp and various webinars and in-person events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was largely a bust. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got around 2\/3 of the way through the JavaScript Bootcamp. I learned a TON and it was a great experience, but it made me realize that my interest in helping small business owners is more on the marketing side than on the development side. I also didn&#8217;t do anything on lynda.com for the same reason &#8212; all of the courses I mentioned previously were technical and I&#8217;d like to focus more on sales and marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to attend at least three webinars or in-person events to keep learning, but didn&#8217;t have good luck there either. A few times I bailed early because they were so bad. Two were pretty good &#8212; one with Cami Farey and one with Kyla Roma (both through Erin Flynn). But the standout was Sara Dunn&#8217;s keyword research workshop. This was a paid workshop and worth every penny. Oh, and I also completed the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Getting Started with ActiveCampaign (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/courses.activecampaign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Started with ActiveCampaign<\/a> course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2020, I would like to take at least one <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"HubSpot course (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/academy.hubspot.com\/courses\" target=\"_blank\">HubSpot course<\/a>. I also signed up for Rebecca Gill&#8217;s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"SEO Bootcamp (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.seobootcamp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">SEO Bootcamp<\/a> in January and am looking forward to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Books<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal for 2019 was to read at least as many books as I did in 2018 (26), however I only read <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"17 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/user\/year_in_books\/2019\/20984500\" target=\"_blank\">18<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started several others but didn&#8217;t finish &#8212; I think because I didn&#8217;t devote specific time to reading. My goal for 2020 is to time block or habit stack regular time for reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I used the 12 week year system consistently each quarter of 2019, but didn&#8217;t always plan for 12 full weeks. I noticed that I get around 9 weeks of quality work done, followed by a 3-4 week break before I&#8217;m ready to start again. Part of being successful with this is the accountability, so I&#8217;ll continue to use the 12 week year system and post my updates in #weekly-standup in Slack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Personal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had several personal goals for 2019 including keep doing fun things with friends and family, keep going to the gym, focus more on diet and get a new desk chair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My top four fun things with friends and family were 1) visiting Ireland with my significant other for 10 days, 2) going to Florida in June with my son, sister and her family, 3) taking a few mornings off during the year to make stuffed cabbage with my dad and 4) going kayaking. I didn&#8217;t get to go camping, so that&#8217;s on my list for 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been going to the gym all. year. long. I celebrated a big milestone in December of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"tracking my fitness goals for three years (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B5vAy73hMuf\/\" target=\"_blank\">tracking my fitness goals for three years<\/a>. But hands down, my absolute favorite part of fitness in 2019 was the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot. I&#8217;ve run this race before, but this was the first time I ran it with my son and significant other (it was their first 5K each). They killed it and it made me so happy. I&#8217;d love to run another race with them in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"2320\" height=\"2320\" src=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/2019-turkey-trot.jpg\" alt=\"2019 Turkey Trot\" class=\"wp-image-4439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/2019-turkey-trot.jpg 2320w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/2019-turkey-trot-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/2019-turkey-trot-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/2019-turkey-trot-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/2019-turkey-trot-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/2019-turkey-trot-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/renemorozowich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/2019-turkey-trot-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2320px) 100vw, 2320px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Diet is tough. I tried a lower-carb diet earlier in the year with not great results. After that, I buried my head in the sand and ignored the scale. In December I got back on track. My goal for 2020 is to find something that works for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, I got the new desk chair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recapping the previous year helps me to see how far I&#8217;ve come and where I want to go.

If you&#8217;re there, you know that you can only put ONE link in your profile or bio. You can&#8217;t put any clickable links elsewhere, which is a huge bummer. What if you want to tell people about your most recent podcast episode or blog post? What if you&#8217;re having an upcoming event that you want to showcase? The answer is a customized social profile page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive in, I&#8217;ll say that the most common link people add is the link to their home page. Linking to your home page isn&#8217;t bad, but there are other (better) options that we&#8217;ll discuss below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using a service for your social profile link<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a TON services out there &#8212; <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"linktree (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/\" target=\"_blank\">linktree<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"linkin.bio (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/linkinbio\/\" target=\"_blank\">Linkin.bio<\/a> or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"taplink (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/taplink.at\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">Taplink<\/a> to name a few &#8212; and there are a lot of advantages to these services. They&#8217;re quick to customize with specific information, tailored to people who are visiting your social media profile.

         "rendered":"\n<p>A custom designed WordPress site isn&#8217;t always in the cards. Luckily, there are TONS of pre-designed themes and templates out there to consider. But how do you decide which theme will work best for your project?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three tips for choosing a WordPress theme that will work well for your project. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first things I check when looking at a new template are the features. Does it have most of what I want, in the format I want it in?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pull up the demo of the theme you&#8217;re considering and look at each of the following areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Header<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Is my logo in the same style and format as the demo? Or is it vertical while the demo is horizontal? Is it the wrong tone or color? What about transparent or colored backgrounds?<\/li><li>Will I have a similar menu as in the demo or will I have many more (or less) items? Do I need more menus than are shown in the demo?<\/li><li>Is there something else about the header that won&#8217;t work? Sticky\/scrolling options, presence or lack of social media icons or other features like quick contact information.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Footer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Can I envision my content in this footer? Will I have similar content? (Or does it have hours, location and a phone number when my site won&#8217;t have that?)<\/li><li>Does it have the correct number of columns or will I want more or less?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Body<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Next check the layout of the body on the home page, inside pages, blog\/archive page and the posts.<\/li><li>Do I like the presence or absence of a sidebar? Do I like which side it&#8217;s on?<\/li><li>What about the width of the pages? Is the content stretched, full width or boxed (and which do I like best)?<\/li><li>Does this theme use breadcrumbs? Page headers with photos? Pre-footer calls to action? Will this work for my project?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing I try to keep in mind are the images, fonts and colors that are currently used on the site. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do my images compare? Are mine similar in tone, color and contrast? Do I have similar interior or outdoor photos? Are the photos offset if needed (for example, a person on one side so that text can appear on the other)? Are the photos in the demo primarily horizontal or vertical and are mine the same?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about fonts and colors &#8212; do I like the fonts and colors in the demo? Changing them drastically would not only take time, but could change the whole look and feel of the theme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Documentation &amp; Support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a theme isn&#8217;t all about how it looks! The last thing I look for is documentation and support. If there isn&#8217;t documentation and support, I know the theme isn&#8217;t a good choice for me. I like to know that after I spend time installing and customizing the theme that I&#8217;ll have somewhere to turn if (when) something goes wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some themes I enjoy working with that have good documentation and support.
